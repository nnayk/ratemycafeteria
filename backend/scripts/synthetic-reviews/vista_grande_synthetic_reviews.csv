1,Vista Grande,"Why is every option here like $12? For that price I could literally go off campus and get something better. It’s not even that the food tastes bad, it’s just super mid for the cost.",2,3,1,5/9/25
2,Vista Grande,"Bro… the pizza line takes like 45 minutes some nights. And when you finally get it, it’s floppy and kinda greasy. Not the worst thing I’ve had but def not worth waiting almost an hour.",2,3,2,5/15/25
3,Vista Grande,Everything is either tiny portions or just boring. Prices keep going up too… it’s brutal when you’re on a meal plan.,3,2,1,5/18/25
4,Vista Grande,"Not sure why people act like it’s poison—some of the bowls I’ve had were fine, actually pretty tasty. But yeah, the portion sizes are small and if you’re hungry after class, it won’t fill you up.",3,2,2,5/27/25
5,Vista Grande,I’ve gotten sick twice after eating here. Not exaggerating. The Balance Cafe sounded great for allergens but honestly the food was bland and repetitive. Ended up living off granola bars instead.,1,2,2,5/28/25
